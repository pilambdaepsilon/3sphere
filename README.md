# fooparam
Want to calculate spherical volumes have access to only radii? Look no further! Fooparam uses the parametrization of Foo et al. to calculate the volume of a 3-sphere given its radius in a user friendly way. It can be used to calculate the 
volume of a single 3-sphere (given a single sphere radius) or several 3-spheres (given a list of 3-sphere radii).
